  <p class="center">After many wonderful years, I closed Brian's Place Barber Shop and moved out of Abbotsford in <span>November 2025</span>.</p>
  <p class="center">To everyone who sat in my chair over the years: thank you. I’m truly grateful for your trust, your loyalty, and the conversations we shared.</p>
  <p class="center">If you'd like to reach me, you can email <span><a href="mailto:bellvuebarber@gmail.com">bellvuebarber@gmail.com</a></span>.</p>

<p>My name is <span>Shannon Lightfoot</span> and I have been cutting hair professionally since <span>1993</span>. Unlike popular opinion, I believe the difference between a good haircut and a bad one is not three weeks, but a lack of <span>communication</span>.</p> <p>I can't read your mind, but if you tell me what you want, I can probably do it. I can't make your hair thicker, although I really wish that I could.</p>

  <p><b><h1><span>THE SHOP</span></h1></b></p>
  <div id="icon"><img src="images/foreground/the-shop.png"></div>
  <p>In <span>1974</span>, the original barbershop was opened by <span>Brian Ross</span> on Cypress Street (Now Gosling Way) in downtown Abbotsford. I came to work with my dad in 1994, and never looked back.</p> <p>Fourteen years later, Brian died suddenly and I made the decision to move the shop to my home, a decision I have <span>never</span> regretted.</p>
